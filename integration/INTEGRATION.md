# Simple Integration to a Web Application

The login.html file contains the necessary HTML code for a login page.
Edit it to needs and taste, but do *not* delete included scripts, the form,
and #status and #messages elements.

The login.js file contains the client-side JavaScript code for the login page.
Only edit window.location.href path and the WebSocket server address.

Just include these files to a web application.

For a test run main.js and open login.html in a browser.

For an example web application check out node-auth-example.
